# Netcode for GameObjects:Chat System Between Users through the Network.
Netcode for GameObjects. Chat Implementation in a Unity Project between 2 players through the Network.


## How it works:
1. Host And Client: One player becomes the host and the other becomes the client and they connect to the same room.
2. Network Input Field RPC: By writing something in the input field and pressing enter it sends it through the network using rpcs for the other user to see it and to receive it.
3. Network Handler: Everything is being handled by Netcode for Gameobjects by Unity.
